# Bear Blog plugins

The following scripts are extentions for the Bear Blog platform. These are not official extensions to Bear and may need a bit of tweaking here and there. [Consider contributing!](/CONTRIBUTIONS.md)

They are separated into **Blog** and **Dashboard** tools to distinguish if they are used on the rendering of the blog, or if they are an extension to the Bear editor and dashboard. 

These extensions can be used by copying and pasting the JS into a `<script></script>` tag in the footer directive of your blog. 

**Copying the code is preferred over linking via the GitHub CDN** 

- It gives you more control over the script which can be modified as you see fit
- It loads instantly without additional network requests
- It prevents plugin updates from negatively affecting your blog

## Blog

### Pagination on blog

Add pagination to blog page and post embeds instead of displaying all posts at once. 

[Code](/plugins/pagination.js)

### Reading time on post

Display the estimated reading time for a post.

[Code](/plugins/reading-time.js)

### Search posts

Search post titles on the blog page with a search input. 

[Code](/plugins/search-posts.js)

### Editor shortcut

Easily open the post or homepage editor using `Ctrl + E`

[Code](/plugins/editor-link.js)

### Copy code button

Adds a button to code blocks to easily copy the content.

[Code](/plugins/copy-code.js)

### Password protect blog

Add a password to a blog in order to view the content.

*Note: This is circumventable by anyone with a decent understanding of JavaScript and so should only be used to protect non-sensitive information.*

[Code](/plugins/password-protect.js)

### Table of contents

Generate a table of contents at the top of a post based on the titles in the post. Configuration at top of script.

[Code](/plugins/table-of-contents.js)

### Post tag links

Display clickable tag links next to each post on the blog page, linking to filtered views.

[Code](/plugins/post-tags.js)

### Redirect www to root

Redirect a custom domain blog with a `www` subdomain to the root domain.

[Code](/plugins/redirect-domain.js)

*Note: This is best added to the `<head>` section instead of the `<footer>` section since it needs to execute immediately.

### Inline currency converter

Converts inline currency amounts to a selected currency using live exchange rates. Add `<span class="currency" data-amount="100 USD">$100</span>` to your posts and a global dropdown will appear allowing readers to convert all amounts at once.

[Code](/plugins/currency-converter.js)

### Translate snippets

Translates Bear Blog UI snippets (footer "Powered by" text, subscribe page, and upvote button labels) into another language. Defaults to Portuguese (pt-BR) — modify the replacement strings for your language.

[Code](/plugins/translate-snippets.js)

### Link previews

Transforms standalone links into rich preview cards showing the page title, description, and meta image. Links must be the sole content of a paragraph (e.g. a bare URL on its own line in Markdown).

[Code](/plugins/link-previews.js)


## Dashboard
These scripts can be added to [the footer of your dashboard](https://bearblog.dev/dashboard/customise/) in a `<script></script>` element.  

### Version history

Store a version history in browser for easy recovery of older versions of posts

[Code](/plugins/version-history.js)

### Full height editor

Expands the post and homepage content editor to the bottom of the screen. 

[Code](/plugins/full-height-editor.js)

### Post counter

Count and display total posts and pages in the dashboard.

[Code](/plugins/dashboard-post-counter.js)

### Fix New Lines in Posts
Automatically ensures all lines have two spaces at the end, so Markdown will render new lines. Without two spaces at the end, text written on different lines (*without a blank line between them*) will render in your post as being on one line.

[Code](/plugins/newline-fixer.js)

### Overtype editor

Replaces the Bear Blog post editor with the Overtype markdown editor, providing syntax highlighting and shortcuts for markdown features.

[Code](/plugins/overtype.js)

### Skip navigation

Adds a "Skip to main content" link as the first focusable element on the dashboard, allowing keyboard users and screen readers to bypass navigation and jump directly to the main content area.

[Code](/plugins/dashboard-skip-nav.js)

### Ace editor

Replaces the Bear Blog post editor with the Ace code editor, providing Markdown syntax highlighting and enhanced editing features.

The plugin loads its dependencies automatically — no extra script tags needed.

The [CSS](plugins/ace-editor/styles.css) file can optionally be added to your Dashboard Styles for a customised Solarized Dark theme with Markdown-aware styling.

[Code](/plugins/ace-editor/ace-editor.js)


### Markdown power-editor

The [Markdown power-editor](https://fischr.org/markdown-power-editor-for-bear-blog/) by René is custom built for Bear and pretty neat.*
